## What To Report / 适合反馈什么

Please open a GitHub issue when you find:

- A formula, condition, proof idea, example, or mistake reminder is wrong or unclear.
- A card is assigned to the wrong subject, chapter, tag, or importance level.
- A lab cannot open, has broken controls, or does not explain the concept clearly.
- MathJax rendering, mobile layout, sidebar scrolling, search, or mastery tracking behaves incorrectly.
- A coverage gap exists for 考研数学一, 同济高数, 同济线代, or 高教社概率统计.

Use the closest issue template:

- `Formula correction / 公式修正` for wrong formulas, conditions, examples, proof ideas, tags, or classifications.
- `Content gap / 内容缺口` for missing chapters, formulas, proof routes, examples, or exam-use explanations.
- `UI or lab issue / 界面或实验室问题` for layout, search, mobile, MathJax, or interactive lab failures.
- `Feature request / 功能建议` for new review workflows, lab ideas, or project improvements.

Accessibility and keyboard issues should usually use the UI/lab template. See `ACCESSIBILITY.md` for current accessibility commitments and checks.

## Useful Details / 反馈时最好提供

For formula issues:

- Card title or card id if visible.
- The current formula and the corrected formula.
- Why the correction is needed: textbook convention, exam syllabus, counterexample, or calculation check.
- Suggested example or proof route if you have one.

For UI or lab issues:

- Page URL.
- Browser and device, for example Chrome desktop, Edge mobile, iPhone Safari.
- Screenshot or short reproduction steps.
- Console error text if available.

## Maintainer Checks / 维护者常用检查

Before merging content or UI fixes, maintainers should run:
