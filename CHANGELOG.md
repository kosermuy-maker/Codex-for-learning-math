# Changelog / 更新日志

All notable changes are tracked here. This project follows a pragmatic changelog style rather than strict semantic versioning.

## Unreleased

- Rebuilt the sub-860px shell as a phone app shell: a sticky top bar (menu + brand + mastery progress), a sticky search row under it, filters behind a `⚙ 筛选` drawer, a five-tab bottom bar (手册 / 实验室 / 复习 / 归因 / 背诵), and a full-screen recite mode.
- Fixed the phone-wide horizontal overflow: grid/flex children kept `min-width: auto`, so the MathJax formula block and the horizontally scrolling recommendation chips forced the page to a 648px minimum width — every 390px phone clipped ~258px on the right and pushed the bottom bar off screen. `min-width: 0` on the long-content children brings the page back to the viewport width at 390/360/320px.
- Fixed the mobile drawer stacking: `.app-shell` (`z-index: 0` + `isolation: isolate`) trapped the fixed sidebar below the root-level scrim, so the drawer rendered dimmed and its `✕` close button received no taps (verified broken on the deployed build). The mobile shell drops that stacking context and the scrim now covers only the strip to the right of the drawer.
- Recommendations now stack vertically on phones, filters fold into a 2-column drawer, and the sidebar close button plus every bottom tab meet the 44px touch target.
- Added safe-area fallbacks (`env(safe-area-inset-*)` always preceded by a plain declaration) for the top bar, search row, bottom bar, recite bar, drawer, and content padding.
- Bumped static app metadata and cache-busted assets to `1.2.0` for the phone app shell.

- Published this copy under `kosermuy-maker/Codex-for-learning-math` so GitHub Pages deploys to `https://kosermuy-maker.github.io/Codex-for-learning-math/handbook/`.
- Bumped static app metadata and cache-busted assets to `1.1.0` for the windowed renderer and mobile recite layout.
- Windowed the card lists: the first 16 cards render up front and an `IntersectionObserver` sentinel appends the next window while scrolling, so the first screen no longer builds and typesets all 494 cards at once.
- Moved MathJax to version 4 with `output.displayOverflow: linebreak`, so long formulas wrap inside their container; formulas that still cannot wrap scroll inside the formula block and show a swipe hint instead of widening the page.
- MathJax now typesets only the formulas that enter the viewport, with a retry pass if the CDN lands late; raw LaTeX stays readable offline.
- Mounted the study layer, usage, examples, mistakes, and lab demos on the first `<details>` expand instead of emitting them for all 494 cards up front.
- Added a mobile recite mode (`#reciteStage`): one card per screen, reveal in two steps, fixed previous/reveal/mastery/next bar, swipe paging, and its own `kaoyan-math-recite-v1` localStorage entry.
- Tightened the sub-860px layout: the hero, toolbar, and keyboard hint no longer consume the first screen, the filters scroll in one row, and 16px inputs stop iOS from zooming on focus.
- Added `handbook/manifest.webmanifest` and `handbook/icon.svg` so the handbook can be added to a phone home screen and opened as a standalone app, and shipped both through the Pages artifact.
- Rewrote the browser smoke contracts for windowed rendering and added a full-corpus MathJax check that typesets all 494 formulas and fails on any `mjx-merror`.
- Replaced the corrupted root `README.md` with a clean bilingual project overview and maintenance guide.
- Added `project-health.js`, generated `PROJECT_HEALTH.md`, and wired the health report into `npm run verify` and generated-output drift checks.
- Added `doctor.js` and `npm run doctor` to distinguish required repository problems from optional local tooling gaps such as missing Playwright.
- Added `CONTENT_GOVERNANCE.md` and gated it in project quality checks so formula additions follow source-tier, condition, and trick-label rules.
- Added content-gap and feature-request issue templates plus issue chooser links for live site, support, and content governance.
- Added `.github/CODEOWNERS` and `MAINTAINERS.md` to document review ownership, merge expectations, and generated-file responsibilities.
- Added `CITATION.cff` and citation metadata checks so reuse of the handbook has a stable repository citation.
- Added `VERSIONING.md` to document static asset cache busting, version bump rules, release steps, and deployment evidence.
- Added `ACCESSIBILITY.md` to document keyboard support, browser smoke accessibility coverage, UI change checklist, and known limitations.
- Added `PRIVACY.md` to document localStorage learning state, lack of app-owned analytics/cookies, third-party MathJax requests, and data clearing steps.
- Added `.editorconfig` and gated it so contributors keep UTF-8, LF line endings, final newlines, and consistent indentation.
- Added a sidebar privacy control to clear local mastery and favorite data from the browser.
- Bumped static app metadata and cache-busted assets to `1.0.3` for the local-data reset UI.
- Upgraded GitHub Actions to `actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/setup-node@v6`, and Node 24 to remove deprecated Node 20 action-runtime warnings.
- Added `.nvmrc` and `package.json` `engines.node >=24` so local development and CI use the same supported Node line.
- Added `link-check.js` and `npm run links` to gate local Markdown links, HTML assets, required project files, package metadata, and Node version alignment.
- Added versioned static asset URLs plus app-version browser checks to prevent stale GitHub Pages caches from breaking labs.
- Added a workflow-based GitHub Pages deployment with a prepared static artifact to replace fragile legacy branch builds.
- Added `deploy-health.js` and `npm run verify:deploy` to audit Pages settings, latest workflow results, and live versioned assets after deployment.
- Wired `verify:deploy` into the Pages workflow as a post-deploy audit step.
- Promoted duplicate formula titles from warnings to validation failures and disambiguated one-dimensional transform cards.
- Expanded sparse high-value lab bindings from 168 to 184 cards and added validation minimums so core labs keep at least three entry cards.
- Bumped the static asset version to `1.0.2` so GitHub Pages serves the refreshed formula data instead of cached lab bindings.
- Added live Chromium lab smoke testing to the Pages deployment workflow so the deployed site must open and exercise lab demos before the deploy is considered healthy.
- Added `generated-check.js` and `npm run generated:check` so regenerated Markdown and `COVERAGE.md` must be committed after data changes.
- Hardened generated-output and formula-data checks against accidental control characters from under-escaped LaTeX commands such as `\rho`.
- Added community health docs: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SUPPORT.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and Dependabot checks for GitHub Actions updates.
- Added `ARCHITECTURE.md` to document the static app data flow, generated artifacts, validation layers, deployment path, and common maintainer change paths.
- Strengthened browser smoke coverage for desktop sidebar scrolling so the last chapter remains reachable after scrolling.
- Added `coverage-report.js` and generated `COVERAGE.md` so chapter, importance, lab, study-layer, and review-target coverage can be audited from GitHub.
- Strengthened `browser-smoke.js` to check keyboard entry points, duplicate IDs, visible button names, mobile hit targets, all desktop lab opening paths, and actual lab control interactions.
- Added `npm run verify:browser:live` for running the same browser smoke checks against the GitHub Pages deployment.
- Expanded the older `taylor-plot`, `tangent-line`, and `matrix-transform` demos with teaching readouts, SVG explanations, and exam-use guidance.
- Expanded 40 shallow review-target formula cards with richer conditions, proof routes, usage steps, worked examples, and mistake notes.
- Raised the minimum card-depth gate in `coverage-report.js` to 125 after the content-depth pass raised the current minimum score to 129.
- Fixed a MathJax `pmatrix` rendering regression by switching the affected inline example to the project-standard `array` matrix form.

## 2026-07-08

- Added `study-layer.js` to generate proof routes, exam scenarios, worked-example breakdowns, and checklists for every formula card.
- Added `quality-check.js` as a maturity gate for learning depth, lab coverage, and direct lab opening behavior.
- Added `browser-smoke.js` for real Chromium checks across desktop and mobile.
- Added GitHub Actions verification for syntax, data validation, docs generation, fake-DOM smoke, quality gates, and browser smoke tests.
- Fixed MathJax rendering issues in several matrix and multivariable formulas.
- Added `.nojekyll` for stable GitHub Pages static asset serving.
